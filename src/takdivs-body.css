.takdivs-body class.

usage:
  * apply .takdivs-body class to the <body> element.
  
  * margin will be removed.

  * in general, you do not need to use this. use .takdivs-window for the
    <body> instead.
  
  * the case when you need .takdivs-body is when you have popup elements that
    should be displayed over your .takdivs-window (like sl-alert from
    shoelace) as the .takdivs-window will allow only the first child to appear.

.takdivs-body {
