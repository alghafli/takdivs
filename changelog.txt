0.0.0:
  * initial release

0.1.0:
  * .takdivs-window size is not the border size.
  * .takdivs-scrolledwindow child size setting is removed. now the child
    defaults to occupying whatever size it needs rather than occupying the whole
    parent size. layout is better if the child size is too small to require
    scrolling.
  * .takdivs-scrolledwindow now can have .no-x class or .no-y class. .no-x will
    prevent scrolling in the x axis and make the child occupy all available
    width. .no-y does the same in the y axis and make the child occupy all
    available height.
  * updated takdivs-box.css brief documentation to include the effect of
    applying .stretch class for the children.  
  * implemented .takdivs-grid.
  * updated --takdivs-border-large variable to 8px.
  * added --takdivs-size-* variables. available variables are small, medium and
    large.
